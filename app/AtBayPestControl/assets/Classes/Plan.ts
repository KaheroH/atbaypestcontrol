// Each Plan will have Infestations, which have Products. We'll want a getProductList function
// We'll also need each plan to have a start date for each infestation, and the dates ordered for each product,
// as well as if each product has been received. This all needs to be stored in the Plan, not the product or
// Infestation!
//
// This is because the Product and Infestation will be what Brandon edits, whereas the plan is based on what the
// customer does
